1.1 Problem Definition 
The WeClerk! comes up with the idea of making life easier for self-employed professionals and 
some micro entrepreneurs, such as carpenters, painters, psychologists, and several other service 
providers. In a successful business, we know that secretaries play a fundamental role, whether in 
clinics, schools, stores. Thus, the main idea of the application is to help professionals (service 
providers) to better organize themselves. 
The application will assist in the scheduling of the professionalâ€™s services, will generate daily 
updates of pending payments, will schedule appointments, and cancel them according to the 
needs of the client/service provider, notifying when changes occurred. 
 
1.2 We Clerk Objectives
WeClerk's main objective is to promote facilities for self-employed professionals. Often these, 
although they need a secretary, cannot afford it financially.
In this way, WeClerk aims to make life easier for self-employed professionals as much as possible.
Although version 1.0 is still rudimentary, some essential functionality is already available, and 
available for use and free trial.
1.3 Assumptions and dependencies 
Making life simpler for self-employed professionals and some microbusiness owners like 
carpenters, painters, psychiatrists, and other service providers is the purpose behind The 
WeClerk.


1.4 Final Considerations 
It is also important to mention that WeClerk! has potential long-term benefits. We strongly
believe that future versions can help the user's life much more.
The main functionality, which is not merely a functionality, is to show the user the difference 
between data and information.
We believe that once the data you generate is well organized, rich information can be generated 
and used for your own good. Saving, in this way, unnecessary resources and worries
